# Training-Platform-for-Micro-Small-and-Medium-Enterprises

## Description
This repo aims to track a product-based capstone project in Bangkit 2022.

## Executive Summary/Abstract: 

The Indonesian government is eager to advance Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise in their business to the digital realm during the pandemic. They have done a lot of training and coaching for 3 majority businesses, specifically in the food/drink, home care, and health care sector. However, what the government is trying to do with training and coaching does not yet have a digital platform that can be used as an online training platform. There are many interests that make it easier for MSMEs in their business if the documentation of training and coaching can be accessed neatly at any time as long as they are connected to the internet. We proposed an idea based on the context we explained. A mobile application that has the purpose of training Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Business. This app has two main features, the first one is user level based on what the user said in the register page, it can be common with zero experience and basic with a little experience. Second, a youtube video ranking recommendation based on likes, views, also user level as in beginner and advanced.
